# SESSION LOG: 2025-04-16

## What was accomplished (2025-04-16)
- Fixed all React controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in TaskFilter and TaskRow components (frontend).
- Added missing axios mocks for `/api/statuses`, `/api/tags`, `/api/assignees` in TaskTable tests (frontend).
- Corrected TaskRow tests to mock PATCH (not PUT) for updates (frontend).
- Confirmed all main task-related frontend tests (TaskTable, TaskRow, TaskDetail, TaskForm, TaskCreate, Home) pass under 40 seconds.
- Resolved React "act(...)" warning in Home.test.tsx by wrapping render in act().
- All backend and frontend tests pass with no warnings or errors.

## Where We Ended (2025-04-16)
- All backend CRUD, filtering, sorting, and CSV endpoints are robust and fully tested.
- All frontend TaskTable, TaskRow, TaskDetail, TaskForm, TaskCreate, and Home tests pass with no warnings.
- Awaiting real CSV and lookup data for full import.
- Next: Set up Git repo, document structure, and continue with advanced frontend filtering and AI chat features.

## How to Continue
- Set up Git repository if not done.
- Import real CSV and lookup data using migration script.
- Continue frontend work: implement UI controls for filtering/sorting on all fields, refine TaskTable and detail views, integrate task-specific AI chat in Task Detail.
- Backend: optimize queries and add indexes for performance, add endpoints for AI chat per task, subtask management, and advanced automation.
- Update documentation as new features are added.
- Check TASK.md, README.md, and DONE.md for latest progress and next steps.
