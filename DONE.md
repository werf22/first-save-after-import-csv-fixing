# DONE.md

## 2025-04-16 (contâ€™d)
- Verified all backend (pytest) and frontend (Jest) dependencies are installed and up to date.
- Ran all backend tests (pytest): all passed in under 4s.
- Ran all frontend tests (Jest): all main component tests passed; network errors in Home.test.tsx are expected due to backend not running during frontend tests.
- Added/updated TaskFilter tests to cover all filterable fields (unit tests pass, <3s).
- Documented that only filterable fields are tested, not every CSV field.
- Enhanced CSVControls UI: now shows success/error notifications and loading indicators for import/export.
- Added robust test coverage for CSVControls (import/export, error/success, <2s per run).
- Extended TaskForm to support AI suggestions for Portfolio, Project, Section, and Tags (with dropdowns/inputs and accept-suggestion buttons for each).
- Added/updated tests to cover AI suggestions and error handling for these extra fields (all pass <4s).
- No manual intervention required for testing; all tasks automated as per project rules.
- Ready for next feature or integration step.
- Backend deployment prepared for Render.com (FastAPI + PostgreSQL). Production config and env setup ready. See render.yaml and .env.example.
- Next: Deploy backend, set up environment variables, verify full-stack functionality, update frontend API URLs if needed.

## 2025-04-16
- Created and pushed initial codebase to GitHub (repo: https://github.com/werf22/first-save-after-import-csv-fixing) after cleaning all secrets from git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner.
- Ensured .env files are removed and .gitignore is updated for security.
- All project files and progress are now safely versioned and public.
- Documentation, file structure, and project state are fully up to date.
- Migrated backend from SQLite to PostgreSQL (updated .env, main.py, created DB, initialized schema).
- Patched CSV import script and /tasks/import/csv endpoint to clean all integer fields and skip rows missing required fields (name).
- Added deep cleaning utility to ensure no nan/invalid values reach DB.
- Imported real CSV data using minimal CSV with only `name` field, as backend import endpoint fails on optional fields. See README.md for workaround and TODO.
- Added enrichment script `patch_tasks_enrich.py` to automate PATCH updates for all tasks after minimal CSV import. This script matches tasks by name and updates fields like `description` and `notes` from the original CSV. All tasks are now fully enriched in the database as of 2025-04-16.
- All backend tests pass with PostgreSQL as backend (pytest <2s).
- Fixed TaskTable frontend tests: ensured unique filter aria-labels, aligned test expectations with field keys, made filter logic robust and case-insensitive, and resolved TS errors in mock data. All tests now pass under 40 seconds.
- Next: Continue frontend and backend improvements, always update docs and commit to GitHub after each step.
