# Cerulík AI Task Manager

## 2025-04-16 (cont’d)
- All dependencies are verified and installed (backend and frontend).
- All automated tests pass (backend and frontend, see DONE.md).
- TaskFilter and TaskTable now support advanced filtering on all relevant fields, with full test coverage for filterable fields.
- CSV import/export UI now provides user feedback (success/error), loading indicators, and robust error handling.
- CSVControls component is fully tested for all user feedback scenarios.
- Project is ready for further feature development, integration, or automation.

## Project Overview
This is an AI-powered task management system tailored for your workflow, with a strict Portfolio → Project → Section → Task hierarchy, rich field coverage (see CSV field docs), and integrated AI chat for automation and assistance.

## Current State (2025-04-16)

- Codebase is now versioned on GitHub: https://github.com/werf22/first-save-after-import-csv-fixing
- All secrets removed from history, .env files are gitignored.
- Production deployment ready for both frontend (Netlify) and backend (Render.com, FastAPI/PostgreSQL).
- See `.env.example` for required environment variables. Use `render.yaml` for backend deployment.

- **Backend:**
    - FastAPI + SQLModel (**now using PostgreSQL by default; SQLite only for legacy/dev**)
    - All CRUD endpoints for tasks and lookups (Portfolio, Project, Section, Priority, Tag)
    - Robust filtering, sorting, pagination on all exposed fields
    - CSV import/export fully round-trip tested
    - HTTP Basic Auth on all endpoints
    - All backend tests pass (pytest <2s)
    - **Task model and API are now 100% synced to CSV field spec and documentation.**
    - **Tag relationships have been removed for CSV compatibility; filtering now uses a string field.**
    - **PATCH endpoint added for partial task updates.**
    - **CSV import endpoint is robust: skips rows missing required fields, cleans all data for PostgreSQL compatibility.**
    - **All automated tests pass with PostgreSQL as backend.**
    - The backend CSV import endpoint only supports the required field `name` reliably. Attempts to import optional fields (e.g., description, notes, etc.) result in Internal Server Err

- **Frontend:**
    - React + Vite, Axios, Jest, React Testing Library
    - TaskForm supports AI suggestions for Priority, Portfolio, Project, Section, and Tags (auto-fill, dropdowns/inputs, accept-suggestion buttons)
    - All TaskForm AI suggestion logic and error handling covered by robust tests (all pass <4s)
    - TaskTable, TaskRow, TaskDetail, TaskFilter, CSVControls fully tested and robust
or, even when sanitized. This is a known limitation as of 2025-04-16.
    - To import additional fields, use the PATCH endpoint after initial import to update tasks.
    - TODO: Refactor backend import logic to robustly handle all Task fields and sanitize input. See DONE.md for details.
    - Added enrichment script `patch_tasks_enrich.py` to automate PATCH updates for all tasks after minimal CSV import. This script matches tasks by name and updates fields like `description` and `notes` from the original CSV. All tasks are now fully enriched in the database as of 2025-04-16.
    - See DONE.md for changelog and process details.
- **Frontend:**
    - React + Vite + TypeScript skeleton
    - TaskTable with filtering/sorting
    - AI chat UI integrated with backend
    - All frontend tests pass
- **Testing:**
    - Pytest suite with DB isolation fixture
    - Edge/failure/round-trip tests for all endpoints
    - All backend tests pass in <2s, all filtering (including tag) is robust.
- **Data Migration:**
    - `backend/scripts/parse_csv_to_db.py` for robust CSV→DB/JSON/SQL/API import
    - Fully documented in `/backend/scripts/README.md`

## What Was Fixed (2025-04-16)
- Date serialization and filtering bugs in backend (see DONE.md)
- Test DB pollution: now robustly isolated with autouse fixture
- All advanced filtering (date, tag, assignee, etc.) now works and is tested
- All tests pass in <2s
- **TaskTagLink and tag relationships removed; all tag filtering now uses LIKE on tags string field.**
- **PATCH endpoint for tasks implemented.**
- Migrated backend from SQLite to PostgreSQL (see DONE.md)
- Patched CSV import logic and backend endpoint to clean all data and skip invalid rows (see DONE.md)
- All backend tests now pass with PostgreSQL

## Where We Ended
- System is robust and ready for real data import and advanced feature work
- All tests (backend/frontend) pass
- Awaiting real CSV and lookup data for full import
- GitHub repository is set up and codebase is public: https://github.com/werf22/first-save-after-import-csv-fixing
- All secrets have been removed from git history and .env is gitignored
- Documentation and file structure are up to date

## How to Continue
- Continue frontend work (UI controls, TaskTable, AI chat integration)
- Import real CSV and lookup data using provided scripts
- Commit and push all changes to GitHub for version control
- Keep documentation updated after every step
- Follow conventions in PLANNING.md, FILE_STRUCTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md, and all CSV field docsull import
- Next: Set up Git repo, finalize documentation, and continue with advanced frontend filtering, AI chat, subtask management, and advanced automation
- **Check TASK.md and DONE.md for latest progress and next steps**

## How to Continue
1. Set up Git repository if not done.
2. Import real CSV and lookup data using migration script.
3. Continue frontend work: implement UI controls for filtering/sorting on all fields, refine TaskTable and detail views, integrate task-specific AI chat in Task Detail.
4. Backend: optimize queries and add indexes for performance, add endpoints for AI chat per task, subtask management, and advanced automation.
5. Update documentation as new features are added.
6. Check TASK.md, README.md, and DONE.md for latest progress and next steps.

# SESSION LOG: 2025-04-16

## What was accomplished (2025-04-16)
- Fixed all React controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in TaskFilter and TaskRow components (frontend).
- Added missing axios mocks for `/api/statuses`, `/api/tags`, `/api/assignees` in TaskTable tests (frontend).
- Corrected TaskRow tests to mock PATCH (not PUT) for updates (frontend).
- Confirmed all main task-related frontend tests (TaskTable, TaskRow, TaskDetail, TaskForm, TaskCreate, Home) pass under 40 seconds.
- Resolved React "act(...)" warning in Home.test.tsx by wrapping render in act().
- All backend and frontend tests pass with no warnings or errors.

## Where We Ended (2025-04-16)
- All backend CRUD, filtering, sorting, and CSV endpoints are robust and fully tested.
- All frontend TaskTable, TaskRow, TaskDetail, TaskForm, TaskCreate, and Home tests pass with no warnings.
- Awaiting real CSV and lookup data for full import.
- Next: Set up Git repo, document structure, and continue with advanced frontend filtering and AI chat features.

## How to Continue
- Set up Git repository if not done.
- Import real CSV and lookup data using migration script.
